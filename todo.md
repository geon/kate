- [x] Make vector foreach use a begin and end expression, instead of constructing it from methodPrefix and vector.
- [x] Make vector work with the struct on the stack.
- [ ] Use the vector in image.
- [x] Use the vector in sprite.
- [x] Make the background use a separate datastructure from sprite. It has no mask and must be aligned to strips.
- [ ] Access background strips by index. Necessary to compare them efficiently.
- [ ] Use tiles for the DirtyBackgroundStrips. Fewer objects should be faster.
- [ ] Use fixed length value arrays in the DirtyBackgroundStrips. More easily reusable like a slab allocator. Should be faster.
- [ ] Use a heap (?) datastructure to store the DirtyBackgroundStrips. Should be faster than scanning it linearly.
