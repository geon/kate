- [x] Make vector foreach use a begin and end expression, instead of constructing it from methodPrefix and vector.
- [x] Make vector work with the struct on the stack.
- [ ] Use the vector in image.
- [x] Use the vector in sprite.
- [x] Make the background use a separate datastructure from sprite. It has no mask and must be aligned to strips.
- [x] Make spriteInstances use vector.
- [x] Separate dirty-marking loop from drawing, avoiding double marking.
- [x] Access background strips by index. Necessary to compare them efficiently.
- [ ] Use fixed length value arrays in the DirtyBackgroundStrips. More easily reusable like a slab allocator. Should be faster.
